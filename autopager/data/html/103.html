In Montreal, taxi drivers have started protest against the on demand taxi services uber &#038; lyft earlier this week. Taxi and limousine drivers in Toronto, Montreal &#038; other cities were argued against to uber for depleting their business and also they wants uber should be regulated as like a traditional taxis for continue operating in Canada.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What is regulation &#038; Why it is needed ?</strong></p>
<p>Regulation is an act to accomplish social, political, natural and financial results that would some way or another not be carried out inside of an open commercial center. Along these lines, regulations are particularly fundamental when rivalry inside of a business sector can possibly abuse customers and mischief society. In such examples, regulations are expected to advantage shoppers and drive a more beneficial business environment.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Be that as it may, the advanced commercial center considers regulations as hostile to development and against rivalry. It&#8217;s frequently contended that guidelines and regulations are superfluous in light of the fact that market powers can viably direct organizations.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There are few strong reasons, on demand taxi services should be regulated for the below reasons. </p>
<p>1. To prevent riders from surge pricing<br />
2. To avoid decreased vehicle quality<br />
3. To avoid accidents due to less experience cab drivers<br />
4. To avoid high density traffic due to arrivals of new taxis on the road<br />
5. To decrease air pollution due to increased taxis.<br />
6. To drivers become prone due to surge pricing<br />
7. To avoid operations struggled to fund for business due to increased competition<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to the recent online survey about banning app based taxis, most of the Canadian people have recommended to regulate Uber as like traditional taxis. Banning app based taxi services like Uber is not a right option to solve inflation of taxi fares. Regulating these service is a most excellent and affluent competition.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.taximobility.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gallery-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.taximobility.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gallery-2.jpg" alt="Skoda superb" width="900" height="558" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-729" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are being a taxi driver, you would probably consider different aspects which includes fuel consumption, price, boot space, terrain etc. When you are looking to buy a car for taxi business, Skoda is one of the popular make because of its reliability and running cost are important factors that influences cabbies to have a look on it. There are few other things you should bear in mind.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Aspects to be considered while buying a taxi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Five Door: </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The cars used for taxis should have five doors because passengers needs to get in and out of the car without any difficulty. Cars with high step to the seat is not an ideal option for passengers as well as they don’t want to climb over the seats. </p>
<p><strong>Space for passengers:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Find a car with sufficient foot space because passengers would like to place their legs comfortably. It will be a horrible journey if they don’t have a space to keep their legs down and they wont choose you again. </p>
<p><strong>Boot space: </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Make sure that the car is having more boot space, because passengers often hail a taxi with luggage, shopping, wheelchairs etc. Especially passengers from airport or railway station will prefer a car which has separate space to keep their luggage. Also you should stow some essential kits like fire extinguisher &#038; first aid kids. </p>
<p><strong>Fuel efficiency: </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Fuel efficient is vital factor while choosing a car for public transportation. You don’t want to fill your fuel tank twice a day. So you must opt for a taxi which delivers high fuel efficiency which helps to reduce the tax cost for emission. </p>
<p><strong>Less maintenance: </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Typically, user cars for taxi business is good choice however, it will not be a reliable a like a new one. Maintenance cost should not erase the savings made on buying the car. Buying an used car in good condition is of a great choice. </p>

<p>In past few years, Information technology and smartphones has rapidly grown and it plays vital part in daily life. Different kind of mobile apps changing the way of life in many ways. In this modern life, Taxi booking apps are one among the essential part of our life which allows us to hail local taxis by tapping away. </p>
<p><strong>Why mobile app based taxis have been so popular</strong></p>
<p>Mobile app based taxis are the most convenient as well as offering an alternative way for customers to hail local taxi cabs.  Though its not new, there is no necessity for taxi companies to bring taxi drivers on their own books. Most of the taxi companies around the world holding fixed taxi fares regulated by the local government. These taxi apps creates free market and also giving unique choices for passengers. </p>
<p><strong>Bad press surrounding taxi-hailing apps</strong></p>
<p>Taxi booking applications have made field days for newsrooms around the globe. There have been dispute by taxi unions, contention about whether laws authorizing their method of operation ought to be passed, security of ride sharing, for example, reports of ambush by drivers, protection scope, security worries about information accumulation and straightforwardness of evaluating frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Is the taxi-hailing application business sector is immersed?</strong></p>
<p>In vast markets like China and the US, for instance, market immersion appears to be just evident in expansive metropolitan ranges. Conversely, suburbia and provincial ranges offer more open doors for littler administrators.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see KuaiDi Dache and Didi contending furiously in extensive metropolitan ranges in China and it&#8217;s a little window. Be that as it may, outside the city, more neighborhood and social variants of these applications have suitable plans of action, regardless of the fact that the enormous organizations are going for scale and enrolling drivers competitively,&#8221; Light said.</p>
<p>These taxi booking applications can possibly expand the social availability, accommodation and feeling of being united for groups and this increases the value of society.</p>

These two taxi firms raised $2 billion by joining together and controlling 99% of taxis market as well 78% of the private car market in China.  Didi Kuaidi&#8217;s CEO Cheng Wei says“The rivalry from Uber is just a tiny wave in our progress,”.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
